Our game is named ball jump(inspired by doodle jump).
There are three difficulties for you to choose at the
beginning: easy, medium, and hard; as well as three types of
platforms: normal, moving and fragile, represented by
the 3 colors, red, green, and blue respectively. 
Shurikens that kill the player upon contact also appear randomly.
There are also toggle able special modes: a bounce mode
which makes the bottom and sides of each platform solid
so that the player cannot pass through them, and a slide
mode that adds momentum to the player as if they were
sliding on ice. To run it you will need cmu_cs3_graphics
and cmu_graphics, which are the only two modules we
used (not including random). Run doodleJumpCracked.py to start.

Additional Note: We initialy intended to add our own drawings to 
the game, but due to some constraints of the cmu graphics package we 
were unable to. These pngs have been included as files.
