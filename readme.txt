Our game is named ball jump(inspired by doodle jump).
There are three difficulties for you to choose at the
beginning: easy, medium, and hard. There are also three
platforms: normal, moving and fragile, represented by
the 3 colors, red, green, and blue respectively. There are
also shurikens which will kill the player upon contact.
There are also toggle able special modes: a bounce mode
which makes the bottom and sides of each platform solid
so that the player cannot pass through them, and a slide
mode that adds momentum to the player as if they were
sliding on ice. To run it you will need cmu_cs3_graphics
and cmu_graphics,which are the only two modules we
used (not including random). Run
doodleJumpCracked.py to start.
